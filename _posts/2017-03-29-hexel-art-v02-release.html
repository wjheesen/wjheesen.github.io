<p>
  I'm pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://wjheesen.github.io/hexelart">Hexel Art v0.2</a>,
  an improvement over the <a href="https://wjheesen.github.io/blog/2017/01/09/hexel-art-prototype">prototype</a> I released in an earlier post.
  The new release features a grid size of upto 512x512 hexels, undo/redo options, semi-transparent draw colors, and a more elegant
  <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr>. Try it out on your smart phone or computer, then leave a comment with your thoughts and suggestions;
  screenshots are also welcome! Here are some of my own:
